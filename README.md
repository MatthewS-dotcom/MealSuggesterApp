# Report
The app I created was for a beloved friend named Hera. It would accompany her busy schedule and help her decide which quick meals she could make depending on the time of day. The times of day shown are morning, mid-morning, afternoon, mid-afternoon, dinner, and after dinner. Allowing Hera to have a choice for the main 3 meals of the day, and if she would like some snacks in between. I used a yellow background because it allows for every other aspect of the apps, like the text, buttons, etc, to pop out and added a picture of some delicous cartoon foods for the eye, the pink reset button stands out to allow the user to easily see the easily accesible button to clear the text completley so they do not need to go back and back space a couple of times for each input. GitHub allows for me to easily allow my code to be accessed by my lecturer or anybody who needs to see it, allowing them to edit it if I give permissions to giving feedback which will enable me to go back onto Android Studio and correct my code and easily update it from Android Studio to GitHub instead of me having to save it and send another link through. I used commit to update all my changes, and from there applied the update to go through to my GitHub repository in two easy clicks. 

# Instructions for installing
1. Where it shows get code. Select that and download the zip file.
2. Extract the file.
3. Select which document folder you would like the file to go into.
4. In Android Studio, select the file and open the file from the folder you placed it in.
5. Wait for it to import.
6. The recommended emulator would be the Medium phone API 35, as it was the one I used to test all of my code onto.
